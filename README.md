Test Gazebo World Design with Robovacuum Simulation


This repository contains a Gazebo simulation environment designed to test robotic vacuum navigation in a room with obstacles. The key features include:

    A custom room design populated with diverse obstacles.
    Two instances of a robovacuum model for multi-robot interaction and testing.
    A world plugin that outputs "Hello Udacity World" when the world is launched in Gazebo (gazebo myworld).
